## About

This project provides a comparative analysis of the open data ecosystems of the London DataStore and the Comune di Milano Open Data Portal. It evaluates their development, adherence to open data principles, and practical utility for urban decision-making.

Key findings include:

* While both platforms offer substantial public data, the London DataStore excels in user experience, data detail, and integrated analytical tools.
   
* Milan's portal is strong in geo-referenced datasets but needs improvement in providing certain essential datasets and ready-to-use insights.
   
* The report identifies areas for enhancing Milan's open data strategy, such as improved accessibility, data detail, and the integration of analytical tools.

This analysis aims to provide insights into how cities can effectively leverage open data to foster innovation, enhance transparency, and improve urban living.

## Technologies

* No specific technologies are mentioned in the report, but the analysis likely involves data analysis and visualization tools. If code files are included in the repository, programming languages or libraries used should be listed here (e.g., Python, R, etc.).

## Usage

* This section should detail how to use or reproduce the analysis. If there are scripts or data files, specify their location and any setup required.  For example: "To reproduce the analysis, download the datasets from the provided links in the report and use the analysis scripts in the 'scripts' directory."  Since the provided example mentions a specific file, if there are any, they should be mentioned here.
